# IFN580-Supervised-Learning-Case-Study

## Overview
This repository contains my individual work for the IFN580 Supervised Learning Case Study 
at Queensland University of Technology (QUT). The project involved data preprocessing and 
the development of three supervised learning models: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, 
and Neural Networks.

## My Contribution
While the preprocessing stage was completed collaboratively as a team, my primary individual work 
focused on implementing and analysing the **Decision Tree model**, including:
- Decision Tree model development using scikit-learn
- Hyperparameter tuning (depth, split criteria, etc.)
- Evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Feature importance analysis
- Visualization of the trained decision tree
- Interpretation of the model outputs and insights
